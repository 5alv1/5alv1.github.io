# Who am I? And What is this?
I'm 5alv1, this is a small project that I'll use to keep track of what I learn, what are my ideas for projects, and the CTFs challenges I participate in.

My real (and complete) name is Cristian Salvi, I was born in december 2003. I'm a Computer Science student at [Universit√† degli studi di Milano](https://unimi.it), I'm passionate about software security and I hope I can start doing research some day!

That's it for this introduction! Check out [my writeups](https://5alv1.github.io/CTFs-writeups) and [my school notes](https://5alv1.github.io/notes).
